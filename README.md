# Flash-Chat



### Goal

One of the most fundamental component of modern iOS apps is the Table View. Table Views are used everywhere from the Mail app to the Messages app. It’s a crucial part of every iOS developer’s tool belt. 



### What is made

Flash Chat is an internet based messaging app similar to WhatsApp, the popular messaging app that was bought by Facebook for $22 billion. I will be using a service called Firebase Firestore as a backend database to store and retrieve our messages from the cloud. 



### What I have learned 

* Integrate third party libraries in your app using Cocoapods and Swift Package Manager.
* Store data in the cloud using Firebase Firestore.
* Query and sort the Firebase database.
* Use Firebase for user authentication, registration and login.
* Work with UITableViews and how to set their data sources and delegates.
* Create custom views using .xib files to modify native design components.
* Embed View Controllers in a Navigation Controller and understand the navigation stack.
* Create a constants file and use static properties to store Strings and other constants.
* Swift loops and create animations using loops.
* The App Lifecycle and how to use viewWillAppear or viewWillDisappear.
* How to create direct Segues for navigation.
